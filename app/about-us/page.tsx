              While we pride ourselves in the science that goes into development
              of each of the products used at a 3M Car Care Store, it is also
              our endeavor to ensure that our customers understand our varied
              range of services with utmost detail. This could be in the form of
              what products we use at these stores, what process we adopt or
              even the chemistry and the physical science behind what makes 3M
              products work so well.

              when you visit a 3M Car Care Store, you would meet an enthusiastic
              store manager who loves what he does and will sometimes go
              overboard in explaining what wonders 3M products can do on your
              car. He will take you through our range of services that can
              transform your car to look like itâ€™s just walked out of a
              showroom. When you do happen to pick one of the several 3M car
              treatments, you can relax in the customer lounge and see your car
              getting transformed into a beauty.
